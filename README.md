# Hi there, I'm Youssef Jo (aka J7) 👋

I'm a 17-year-old student from Alexandria, Egypt 🇪🇬, passionate about building things that matter — from electronics to software.

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 I'm most confident in programming (Python is my favorite!), but I also enjoy editing videos, photos, and designing logos.
- 🔧 I’ve worked with ESP32, Pi Pico, and a wide range of Python libraries.
- 🌐 I know HTML, CSS, and use Linux, CMD, and PowerShell daily.
- 🤖 Currently leading the software team on an ROV project.
- 🧠 I’ve completed many challenges in PicoCTF and love learning through problem-solving.
- 📷 I’ve also worked on a project using OpenCV to assist patients with motor disabilities.

## 🛠 Projects
- **Assistive Communication System**: Built from scratch using Raspberry Pi and speech recognition to help patients with ALS and similar conditions.
- **ROV Development**: Software lead on a team building an underwater ROV.
- **Education Initiative**: Founded and led a tech education initiative reaching over 600 students, teaching programming, physics, and research skills.

## 🎯 Goals
- Get into college and pursue a double major in **cybersecurity**, **mechanical engineering**, or **computer science**.
- Become a **professional ethical hacker** and publish my own **startup** in tech and electronics.
- Build inventions that make life easier and better for everyone.
